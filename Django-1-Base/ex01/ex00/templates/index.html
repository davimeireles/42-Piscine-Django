    Markdown is a lightweight and intuitive markup language designed for formatting plain text. It allows writers to structure documents using simple syntax rules that are easy to read and write. Markdown supports a range of formatting features including headings, emphasis, lists, links, images, blockquotes, code, tables, and more.

    Headings are created using the hash symbol (#). One # creates a top-level heading (h1), two ## create h2, and this continues up to six levels. To write paragraphs, simply separate blocks of text with a blank line. Line breaks can be created by ending a line with two spaces or using <br> in raw HTML.

    Text formatting options include italic text using either *italic* or _italic_, and bold using **bold** or __bold__. You can also combine them for bold italic, and use ~~text~~ for strikethrough. Inline code is written using backticks like `code`, while larger code blocks can be created using triple backticks or indentation with four spaces. Syntax highlighting in fenced code blocks is supported by some Markdown engines when a language name is added after the opening backticks (e.g., ```python).

    Links are created using square brackets followed by parentheses, such as [example](https://example.com), and images use the same syntax but with an exclamation mark at the beginning, like ![alt text](image.jpg). Blockquotes are written using the greater-than symbol (>), and they can be nested or span multiple lines. Horizontal rules are made using three dashes (---), asterisks (***), or underscores (___) on a line by themselves.

    Markdown also supports both ordered and unordered lists. Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period (1., 2., 3.), while unordered lists use dashes (-), asterisks (*), or plus signs (+). Task lists can be created using - [ ] for incomplete tasks and - [x] for completed ones, though this feature is specific to GitHub Flavored Markdown.

    Tables in Markdown consist of columns and rows separated by vertical bars (|). You can control alignment by adding colons: :--- for left-aligned, :---: for center-aligned, and ---: for right-aligned columns. Contextual variables or dynamic elements are not native to Markdown but are often added through processing engines.

    Additionally, Markdown allows inline HTML, so tags like <b>, <i>, <br>, and others can be used directly when necessary. Escape characters can be added using backslashes (e.g., \* to display a literal asterisk). GitHub Flavored Markdown extends standard Markdown with support for checkboxes, syntax highlighting, automatic linking of URLs, and more.

    Overall, Markdown is a simple yet powerful tool for formatting text on the web, especially popular for documentation, READMEs, wikis, blogs, and static site generators.
